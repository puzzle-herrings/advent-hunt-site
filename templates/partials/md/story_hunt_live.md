You arrive at the North Pole on time, after a safe and smooth flight. As you step off the sleigh, you notice an elf, impeccably dressed in a festive yet formal-looking Christmas suit, walking briskly to meet you. Just as he's about to greet you, another elf comes running suddenly.

"Red! Red!" she shouts. She runs up to who you assume must be Red, the elf that you've been in contact with to coordinate your trip. The two elves enter into a furious whispered conversation. As they confer, you see Red becoming more and more distressed.

"Oh no…" Red groans as they conclude their conversation and the second elf runs off. He briefly holds his face in his hands before taking a deep breath and turning to you.

"I'm terribly sorry about that. That was rude of us. I'm Red, Santa's Chief of Staff. It's so lovely that you're able to join us here," he says, visibly making an effort to appear friendly and cheerful. He takes a deep breath again before continuing, "Unfortunately, we're in a bit of a crisis right now. **You see, Santa has gone missing.** We've been looking all over, and we don't know where he is... Oh sugarplums! What are we going to do…" he says as he drops his head back into his hands.

"I'm so sorry again," he says after collecting himself. "I know you came all this way, but I'm going to have to postpone some of the activities that we had planned for you. You see, all of the elves are busy ramping up production for Christmas, and I'm the only one who can make time to search for Santa. It's a real puzzle where he could have gone. Oh… and I'm not very good at puzzles..."

_Wait a second, I like puzzles!_ You quickly offer to help Red with his search.

"Really?!" he responds with relief. "Oh, thank you so much. I should've known you'd want to help, what with your niceness record and all. I'm so lucky you're here." He beckons you to follow as he sets off at a brisk walk, saying "First, we'll go search…"
